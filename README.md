# ChessGame
Trying to create my first game, Chess.
First, I'll create the most simple engine possible. Player vs Player, no AI. No game situations (yet), like Check, Checkmate or draw.
Second, I'll add the UI components for user experience.
Third, add all necessary features to make the game complete (game situations).
Fourth, add a self developed AI to play against.
Fifth, bug fixes, performance improvements etc.

That's it. :)
