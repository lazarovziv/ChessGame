# ChessGame
Trying to create my first game, Chess.

Creating it for gaining more knowledge and experience in this field of expertise and in "allegedly" big projects.
My first project in this scale.
On the verge of finishing all of the pieces' special and abnormal moves like Castling, En Passant, etc.
When finished, I will work on game situations. All by myself (like the song haha), no tutorials or videos on chess development or anything like that.
My goal is to make this project as a self achievement. Only way to develop yourself is to build things in your own standards.

When the game'll be complete, I'll add an AI player. Will figure out if through Deep Learning model or simple algorithm like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta pruning.

Thank you for looking into my project, hope you enjoyed my code!

For starting a GUI game, (which is still in the works) go to ui/game/ChessGame.java.
For a Command Line game, go to ui/CommandLineGame.java. It is less intuitive but for now, more informative for the player.
